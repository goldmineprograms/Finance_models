# Finance_models
Trying out different financial models

1) capm_sma_strategy.py: Capital Asset Pricing Model combined with a Simple Moving Average for each individual stock
2) conintegration_pairtrading: A rendition of pair trading where I take the cointegration of two stocks
3) Positive_Correlation_Pairstrading: Another rendition of pairs trading, but instead I explore whether the two stocks are positively correlated as well as cointegrated
